<h1 class="mat-h1">About Polaris</h1>

<p>Polaris is a HTML visualization for the <i>Process Orchestration Layer</i> (POL) tool proudly presented by the <a
        href="https://tu-dresden.de/ing/elektrotechnik/ifa/plt">P2O-Lab</a> from TU Dresden. It helps you to control the
    modules connected to the POL and perform service orchestration with them. Thus, you can
    integrate modules (precisly named Process Equipment Assemblies) by loading its interface descriptions stored in a JSON file.
    This JSON file can automatically be
    generated from a MTP of this module.

<h2 class="mat-h2">Modules</h2>
<p>The POL can control multiple modules. Modules are loaded via JSON files which describe the necessary communication
    variables to interact with. </p>


<h2 class="mat-h2">Service</h2>
<img width="60%" src="assets/service_state_machine.png">
<p>Each service consists of a finite state machine which is used to control the service. For that,
    commands on the <a routerLink="/modules">modules view</a> are used to trigger state transitions.</p>


<h2 class="mat-h2">Recipes</h2>
<p>Recipes are also loaded via JSON. They describe in a declarative way which steps should be executed one after another
    and which actions should be taken in each step (e.g. starting or stopping a service). Furthermore, each step defines
    a set of transitions which lead under a defined condition to a next step.</p>

<h2 class="mat-h2">Playlist</h2>
<p>You can dynamically enqueue recipes in a playlist which then can started. This allows to define a set of recipes
    which will be executed one after another. The external trigger can also be used to start the playlist.
    If external trigger is true and the playlist is currently not running, the playlist will be started.</p>
