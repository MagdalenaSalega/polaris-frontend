# Setup of REE for CBRMF


The REE is readily deployed on the raspberry pi. It starts automatically in the boot process and is available under the IP address 10.6.51.43
Just open `http://10.6.51.43:3000` in your browser and follow the general instruction manual.

The biofeed module as well as the default recipes are already loaded into the REE at startup.
